# The One-Liner That Will Save You in Changelog Meetings

You know the drill. It's Monday, and the team has gathered for your weekly changelog meeting to talk about what was shipped. You’re sitting there, desperately scrolling through commits, trying to remember all the things you did last week. Panic sets in. Did I fix that bug? Did we push that feature?

Wouldn't it be nice if there were a simpler way to be prepared for these moments? You know, without the stress-induced memory dump of the last seven days? Well, my friends, there _is_ a way, and it’s just one magical line in your terminal:

```bash
git log --since='7 days ago' --author="Rob Dominguez" --oneline
```

## So, What Does This One-Liner Do?

Glad you asked. This little gem shows you every commit from the last seven days, _in a beautifully concise format_. No extra noise, no giant commit messages clogging up your view, just a nice clean list of everything you shipped (or _meant_ to ship) in the past week.

## Breaking It Down:

- **`git log`**: We all know this one. It's your friendly neighborhood git command to see commit history.
- **`--since='7 days ago'`**: This is the key. You’re telling Git, “Hey, I only care about the past seven days. Let’s skip the archaeology and get right to the good stuff.”
- **`--author='Your Name'`**: It's me — I'm the problem.
- **`--oneline`**: Let’s be real, nobody wants to read a novel in the middle of a meeting. This trims down each commit to a single line, showing just the commit hash and message. Short, sweet, and to the point.

## Why Use This?

If you're like me, you probably don't have time to sift through every little thing you did in the past week, let alone remember it all. This command has become my trusty sidekick for changelog meetings.

Boom. No stress, just results.

## The Takeaway

At the end of the day, preparing for changelog meetings shouldn’t be a stressful fire drill. With this one-liner, you can _effortlessly_ walk into that room ready to discuss everything you shipped (and probably a few things you didn’t even remember doing). It’s simple, it’s powerful, and it’s one less thing to worry about.

Now, go forth and impress your team with your preparedness. Or, at the very least, pretend you’ve had it together all week.
