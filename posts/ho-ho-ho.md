# Secret Santa's Secret Helper

### There's not much to this post...

Why? Well, it's an incredibly simple script. I could just point you to the [repo](https://github.com/robertjdominguez/secret-santa), you could check out the readme, and we'd be done...but, maybe I'll elaborate a bit.

This is a handy example of how to use Twilio to send messages to mobile phones. The script simply shuffles a list of people and their phone numbers and then assigns pairings based on that circular order. However, it does make your life a lot easier if you're the one responsible for bringing people together - in a sense - during a tough year.

Check out the [code](https://github.com/robertjdominguez/secret-santa) and go to town!
