hook: "A 7+ hour drive from Cedar Rapids, IA back to Birmingham gave me plenty of time to build out a game for my students. I'm also close to launching a complete curriculum coupled with features for teachers looking to save some time and energy. This is as close as to 'building in public' that I've been comfortable with to date."

# What's that code again?

### Overview

In my last post, I mentioned that I'm working on a SaaS for educators. I'm _so_ close to finishing! The main modules' content has been built out and I'm nearly done with the formative assessments (quizzes) that accompany each lesson. I still need to build out assignment and project repos, but that should come pretty quickly. While I'd planned to finish out a lot of this detail over the past week as I rode in the backseat with my wife's family to a wedding in Iowa...my curiosity got the better of me and I wanted to see how quickly I could build out a game/service for my students and anyone else looking to test their knowledge of HTTP response codes.

First, the Great American Roadtrip is only amplified when sitting in the backseat developing. My wife, tired of getting her ass kicked in Mario Kart, claimed the Switch while we made it back from our first post-vaxxed family vacation. I could have counted wind turbines or marveled at...all...that...corn. Or, I could elect to be productive. I chose none of these options; instead, I **procrasticoded** [this game that quizzes you on ten random HTTP status codes](https://status-game.dominguezdev.com). This site is the product of the 869-mile return leg as we made our way through Indianapolis (which is an _amazing_ city).

### The Reason

Kids hate memorizing things. Hell, adults hate it, too. However, we all love games and to compete with one another. My original goal was to simply have an online option for my students to test their knowledge on different HTTP response codes. However, it quickly morphed into an opportunity to advertise and continue building a marketing base for the launch of my educational service later this fall. My hope is that the newsletter sign-ups will encourage a few of you to add your names to a spam-free list. I'll simply give you a shout when the complete educational package is ready to go ðŸ¤™

### The Stack

FWIW, this was a fairly quick build with minimal set-up. I've been a huge fan of Next.js recently and wanted to build more on it. So, this was an other opportunity to practice. Aside from that, the only real heavy additions are [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for the animations and [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) for the UI animations on sign up.
