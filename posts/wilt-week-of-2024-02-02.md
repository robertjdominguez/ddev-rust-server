# WILT: Week of 2/1/2024

# WILT: Reflections on Refactoring, Automation, and API Interactions

Another week has flown by, sprinkled with moments of clarity and the occasional facepalmâ€”such is the life of a software engineer who's as cynical as he is self-deprecating. Let's dive into this week's WILT and break down some of the nerdy nuggets I encountered.

## Embracing TypeScript's Power Through Octokit

My journey of refactoring the cherry-picking utility for Hasura DDN beta docs has been a testament to TypeScript's prowess. There's something magical about TypeScript and its type system. For instance, deciphering and anticipating the shape of objects using Octokitâ€™s types turned the once arcane task of API manipulation into a remarkably pleasant endeavor. It's like having a cheat sheet for every exam â€” I'm starting to wonder if this is a coder's version of 'easy mode'.

### The Pitfalls of Pipe Operators and Armchair Problem Solving

In my previous implementation, the pipe operator felt like a hammer in search of a nail â€“ it made the code work but lacked elegance. The result was a confusing mess, like trying to decipher my own handwriting. I had this aha! moment when I realized I could throw an error to simplify the error handling process. I refined my code, and here's a taste of what it looks like now:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await someAsyncFunction();
  // Do something with the result
} catch (error) {
  // Gracefully handle the error
}
```

This approach is as neat as my desk on a good day, which is a rarity, but letâ€™s not go there.

## Automating the Tedious with GitHub Actions

Ah yes, automationâ€”the programmerâ€™s panacea. Weâ€™re finally implementing continuous deployment (CD) for the Hasura DDN documentation site. Itâ€™s like creating a conveyor belt made of code: PRs are approved, merged into staging, and then a GitHub Action takes its cue, sending everything off to production like well-behaved soldiers. No more manual cherry-pickingâ€”a task I'm convinced was conceived by someone who hates joy.

Here's the essence of automation scripted in a GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: Automate Cherry-picking

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  cherry-pick:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Check out the repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}
    # More steps for checking labels and cherry-picking commits...
```

Crafting this felt as satisfying as poking bubble wrap, which for the uninitiated, is the coder's version of a stress ball.

## Parsing OpenAI's JSON Mode with a Side of Irony

Time spent experimenting with JSON mode in the OpenAI API confirmed my hypothesis: it's undeniably efficient for our docs-assertion-tester, yet Iâ€™m stuck parsing strings into JSON. I chuckle at the irony; didn't we create machines to save us from the mundane? I digress.

Hereâ€™s an example of parsing the API response, which, while comical in its triviality, is necessary:

```javascript
const response = await openAiApiCall();
const parsedResponse = JSON.parse(response);
```

The silver lining came to light when I realized giving the API a one-shot example in the prompt led to better results, even if the process felt as roundabout as explaining recursion to a philosophy major.

My weekly musings may seem like an odd mix of complaints and celebrations, yet itâ€™s in this contrast where growth happens â€” a lesson I learn every week. With that, I'll wrap up this week's WILT. Stay tuned for the next series of revelations and perhaps some more self-deprecating humorâ€”after all, itâ€™s hard to take oneself too seriously when your day is spent conversing with machines.
