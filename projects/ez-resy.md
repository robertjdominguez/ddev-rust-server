I'm hungry and like to eat well. What can I say? 🤷‍♂️

This script allows you to make a reservation at a restaurant on Resy. It's ideally run on a cron job, but can be run manually as well. Imagine picking your day and ideal time, and then letting the script do the rest. It's that easy. No more wait-lists, no more checking the app every 5 minutes. Just set it and forget it.

## Motivation

One day, Highlands Bar & Grill will reopen. And when it does, I want to be there. I want to be there so bad that I wrote this script to make a reservation for me. Goddammit, I want that cornbread.

## What it actually does

- Automated reservation sniping for Resy restaurants
- Configurable time windows and party sizes  
- Cron job friendly for set-it-and-forget-it operation
- Simple configuration with environment variables
- Handles authentication and payment methods automatically

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript** - Core automation logic
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment  
- **Shell Scripting** - Environment management and automation

It works...most of the time. Which is about all you can ask for from a script that's basically just a glorified web scraper with commitment issues.
